Welcome to my homepage.

<p>
  I’m <strong>Young Hyun Cho</strong> (please call me <strong>Young</strong>), a <strong>5th-year Ph.D. candidate</strong>
  in the <strong>Department of Statistics at Purdue University</strong>. I work with
  <a href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~sun244/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Wei Sun</a>
  and
  <a href="https://jordan-awan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan Awan</a>.
  Previously, I was advised by
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/johanlim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Johan Lim</a>
  at <strong>Seoul National University</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Broadly, I aim to contribute as a statistician to modern data-driven decision making, especially in the era where
  AI systems and LLMs increasingly enter the decision loop. My research centers on sequential decision making
  (e.g., reinforcement learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning) and trustworthy decision support,
  including uncertainty quantification and privacy-preserving learning and inference.
